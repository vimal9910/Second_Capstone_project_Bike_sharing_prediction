# Second_Capstone_project_Bike_sharing_prediction


In our project, we chose to analyse a dataset pertaining to Rental Bike Demand from
South Korean city of Seoul, comprising of climatic variables like Temperature,
Humidity, Rainfall, Snowfall, Dew Point Temperature, and others. For the available
raw data, firstly, a through pre-processing was done after which a Here, hourly rental
bike count is the regress and. To an extent, our linear model was able to explain the
factors orchestrating the hourly demand of rental bikes.
We calculated the r2 Score for these models and select the best model from these
models Linear Regression , elastic net , gradient boosting regression, decision Tree
regression, Lasso regression(regularized regression),Ridge regression(regularized
regression), Random forest.

Thus Gradient Boosting Regression(GridSearchcv) and Random
foreset(GridSearchCv) gives good r2 Scores.we can deploy this model.
